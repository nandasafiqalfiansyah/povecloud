# PoveCloud 🌥️

PoveCloud is a platform for hosting websites and managing cloud file storage. It provides a secure environment for hosting your website along with a cloud file structure for efficient file management. The project is built in Go, designed with a clean architecture, and features both frontend and backend components to manage authentication, file uploads, and website hosting.

## Features ✨

- **Website Hosting**: Host your static and dynamic websites with ease.
- **Cloud File Storage**: Manage files securely in the cloud with a well-organized structure.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and user management via Firebase.
- **File Management**: Upload, download, and organize files in the cloud.

## Requirements 🛠️

Before running PoveCloud, ensure that you have the following tools installed:

- Go (version 1.18 or later)
- Firebase account for authentication setup
- A local environment to test the application (or cloud setup)

## Installation 🔧

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/povecloud.git
   cd povecloud
   ```

2. **Install Go dependencies**:
   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

3. **Set up Firebase Authentication**:
   - Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   - Create a new project and enable Firebase Authentication.
   - Download your Firebase credentials and set them up in the environment variables or `config.go`.

4. **Configure the app**:
   Edit the `config/config.go` file to set any necessary environment-specific configurations (e.g., port, Firebase settings, etc.).

## Usage 🚀

1. **Run the server**:
   ```bash
   go run cmd/server/main.go
   ```

2. **Test the API**:
   You can interact with the API using tools like Postman or cURL to test endpoints such as:
   - **User Authentication**: `/auth/login`, `/auth/signup`
   - **File Management**: `/files/upload`, `/files/download`

3. **Access the Frontend (if available)**:
   For a full-featured web interface, simply open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8080` or your configured domain.

## API Endpoints 📡

### Authentication

- **POST /auth/login**  
  Login with Firebase authentication.
  
- **POST /auth/signup**  
  Register a new user using Firebase authentication.

### File Management

- **POST /files/upload**  
  Upload a file to the cloud storage.

- **GET /files/download/{file_id}**  
  Download a file from the cloud storage.
